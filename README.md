## Hi there, I'm Alejandra <img src="https://media.tenor.com/nebZyl8oN7IAAAAi/wave-hello.gif" style="width: 25px;">

🔭 I am a software developer with a focus on frontend technologies, though I am also skilled in backend development. Beyond my coding skills, I have a strong interest in design which allows me to combine technical expertise with a good eye for design. With a growth mindset I am a strong advocate of self-education, and I'm always trying to learn more about the things that interest me the most. Currently contributing to FastAPI & friends. 

🌱 I am currently delving more into software development and learning about UX/UI design.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Programming languages**: JavaScript | TypeScript | Python | C
- **Frontend**: React | Angular | HTML | CSS | SASS
- **Backend**: FastAPI | SQL databases
- **Other tools**: Docker | Git

🎲 As a random fact, I'm an enthusiast photographer (mostly analog) and a cat lady. 🐈📷

📍 Medellín, CO
