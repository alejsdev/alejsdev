## Hi there, I'm Alejandra <img src="https://media.tenor.com/nebZyl8oN7IAAAAi/wave-hello.gif" style="width: 50px;">

🔭 I'm a software developer with focus and experience in frontend technologies also skilled in backend development.Beyond my coding skills, I have a strong interest in design which allows me to combine technical expertise with a good eye for design. With a growth mindset I am a strong advocate of self-education, and I'm always trying to learn more about the things that interest me the most. Currently contributing to FastAPI & friends. As a random fact, I'm a enthusiast photographer (mostly analog) and a cat lady. 🐈

🌱 I'm currently delving more into software development and learning about UX/UI design.
